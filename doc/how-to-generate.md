# Background knowledge

Autorest.az supports two kinds of code genreation now: full and incremental. Their description are as following:
* Full: generate full Az Cli code for RP. All files will be generated.
* Incremental: generate Az Cli code based on existing Az Cli code. The existing code will not change, while new generated code will be integreated into existing code. 

Currently, autorest.az only support generate code target to cli extension repo. Target to cli repo will be supported soon.

There are totally 3 approaches to use autorest.az now:
* Through PR in **Swagger repo**
* Through **Docker**
* Through autorest command directly in **local**

The following tables shows that which approaches can be used for different scenarios:

Approaches | Cli | Cli Extension
-----------|-----|--------------
Full       | N/A | All approaches
Incremental| N/A | **Docker** and **Local**

The preparation and autorest command for full/incremental, target to cli/cli-extension may have difference. The following will talk it.

## Full codegen to cli extension
* **Readme**: [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md). 
* **Autorest command**: 
As autorest.az support auto detect full/incremental generation mode. The rule is:
    * If cli extention folder for target RP is empty, or not empty but code is generated by az code generator before, full code generation mode will be run.
    * If cli extention folder for target RP is not empty and the code is generated manually before, incremental code generation mode will be run.

You can just using the following command for full code generation target to cli extension repo.
 ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```
 You can also add --generation-mode=full to force generate full code as following:
  ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} --generation-mode=full {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```

## Incremental codegen to cli extension
* **Readme**: Besides following [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md). Incremental contents need also be configure in the Readme.az.md file. There are two type of configure:
    * **Allow list** will use hidden flag to hide all command first. Then unhide the command group or command which need to be incremental generated. The sample are as following:

      ![Allow list](images/allowlist.png)
    * **Deny list** also use hidden flag. But it will directly hide the command which has been implement before. The sample are as following:

      ![Deny list](images/denylist.png)

* **Autorest command**:
As autorest.az support auto detect full/incremental generation mode. The rules are list [Here](how-to-generate.md#L27-L28). You can just using the following command for full code generation target to cli extension repo.
 ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```
 You can also add --generation-mode=incremental to force generate full code as following:
  ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} --generation-mode=incremental {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```

## Full codegen to cli
You can use `--target-mode=core` change the `--azure-cli-extension-folder` to `--azure-cli-folder` to generate cli modules. see [here](how-to-generate-with-different-options.md#generate-cli-main-repo-modules-with-default-option) for more details.  
You also use other interesting options when generating the cli. see [here](how-to-generate-with-different-options.md#what-kind-of-options-do-we-have) for more details.  

## Incremental codegen to cli

# How to generate code using autorest.az

## Through PR in [Swagger repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs)

Autorest.az has been integrated into the [swagger repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs), which means it will be triggered automatically to generate the CLI code and extension for you without any extra effort as long as the readme files are ready in the swagger repo or PR. To preparing the initial readme file, please following [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md). 

The following is code generation step by step:

1. Create the PR in Swagger repo.

2. Try az cli extension. 

![try change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-try.JPG)

3. Review auto generated Az cli extension code. 

![preview change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-review-link.JPG)

![review change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-review-code.JPG)

4. Modify and Merge

    a. If nothing need to be changed after review and try, you can merge the swagger PR. After swagger PR is merged, another PR target to [Az cli extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions) will be created but marked as closed. Following the link in pipeline, find the PR for Az cli extension, reopen it and ask for code review.

    ![preview change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-release-link.JPG)

    b. If you want to change Az cli auto generated code, please pull the Az cli extension PR to local, which you reviewed in step 2.

    ![review change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-review-code.JPG)

    You can changing the cli code, test and try in local environment with [developing guideline](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/configuring_your_machine.md). After completed, please create the Az cli extension PR target to [Az cli extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions) directly.

## Through Docker

We have pre-prepared docker image for you to use autorest.az easily. (Please make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products) has been installed. :))

1. Start docker:
    * sync 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions.git' to {azure_cli_ext_folder} and 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs.git' to {swagger_folder}
    * login to Azure Container Registry and start the docker
    ``` bash
    > az acr login --name amecodegen
    > docker run -v {swagger_folder}:/home/swg -v {azure_cli_ext_folder}:/home/azext -it amecodegen.azurecr.io/az:2020.05.24 /bin/bash
    ```

2. Generate the code:
    * Make sure the readme files are ready in the swagger repo. We can help to prepare the init readme files for you as mentioned in [onboarding-guide](onboarding-guide.md), or you can also find example [here](../test/scenarios/attestation/configuration).
    * Generate the code:
    ``` bash
    > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder=/home/azext /home/swg/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
    ```

3. Run the generated command
    * Generated commands are ready to use after adding the extension:
    ``` bash
    > azdev extension add {service_name}
    # your command is ready to use now
    ```

4. Run generated test cases and style check
    * run azdev test
    ``` bash
    > azdev test {service_name}
    ```

    * run azdev linter
    ``` bash
    > azdev linter {service_name}
    ```

    * run azdev style
    ``` bash
    > azdev style {service_name}
    ```

## Through autorest command directly in local
1. Make sure your environment is good to run autorest and autorest.python by following [this](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.python/wiki/Generating-with-autorest-for-python-v5.0.0).
2. sync 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions.git' to {azure_cli_ext_folder} and 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs.git' to {swagger_folder}
3. Generate the code:
    * Make sure the readme files are ready in the swagger repo. To preparing the initial readme file, please following [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md).
    * Generate the code:
    ``` bash
    > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder}   {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
    ```

3. Run the generated command
    * Build az extension from the generated code and load it in az
    ``` bash
    # run this in the folder with generated code: {azure_cli_ext_folder}/src/{service_name}
    > python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    > az extension add --source={azure_cli_ext_folder}/src/{service_name}/dist/{generated .whl file}
    # your az command is ready to use :)
    ```
4. Run the generated test
    * Follow the [guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/authoring_tests.md) from azure-cli for running test.

5. Run linter and style check
    * Follow the [guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/configuring_your_machine.md#running-tests-and-checking-code-style) to run linter and style check.
