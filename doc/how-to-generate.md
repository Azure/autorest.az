# Background knowledge

Autorest.az supports two kinds of code genreation now: full and incremental:
* Full: generates the full Az Cli code for RP. All files are generated.
* Incremental: generate Az Cli code based on existing Az Cli code. The existing code will not change. New generated code will be integrated into existing code. 

There are 3 approaches to use autorest.az:
* **Swagger** repo pull request
* **Docker**
* **Locally** running autorest command

The following table shows which approaches can be used for which scenarios:

Approaches |         Cli                | Cli Extension
-----------|----------------------------|--------------
Full       | **Docker** and **Locally** | All approaches
Incremental| **Docker** and **Locally** | **Docker** and **Locally**

The preparation and autorest command for full/incremental, target to cli/cli-extension have differences.

## Full codegen to cli extension
* **Readme**: [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md). 
* **Autorest command**: 
As autorest.az supports auto detect full/incremental generation mode:
    * If the cli extention folder for target RP is empty or the code was generated by autorest.az before, then full code generation mode will be run.
    * If the cli extention folder for target RP is not empty and the code was manually written before, incremental code generation mode will be run.

Use the following command for full code generation targeting the cli extension repo.
 ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```
 You can also add --generation-mode=full to force full code generation:
  ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} --generation-mode=full {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```

## Incremental codegen to cli extension
* **Readme**: Besides following [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md). Incremental mode needs to be configured in the Readme.az.md file. There are two ways to configure incremental mode:
    * **Allow list** hide all commands by setting hidden to true. Then unhide the command groups or commands to be generated:

      ![Allow list](images/allowlist.png)
    * **Deny list** make all commands visible and hide the command groups or commands to not be generated:

      ![Deny list](images/denylist.png)

* **Autorest command**:
As autorest.az supports auto full/incremental generation mode. The rules are list [here](how-to-generate.md#L27-L28). Use the following command for full code generation targeting the cli extension repo.
 ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```
 You can also add --generation-mode=incremental to force incremental code generation:
  ``` bash
 > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder} --generation-mode=incremental {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
 ```

## Full codegen to cli
Use `--target-mode=core` and change the `--azure-cli-extension-folder` to `--azure-cli-folder` to generate cli modules. see [here](how-to-generate-with-different-options.md#generate-cli-main-repo-modules-with-default-option) for more details.  
Other interesting options available when generating the cli are list [here](how-to-generate-with-different-options.md#what-kind-of-options-do-we-have) for more details.  

## Incremental codegen to cli
The configuration is basically the same as extension incremental generation, except you need to add `--target-mode=core` when you run `autorest --az` command.

# How to generate code using autorest.az

## Through PR in [Swagger repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs)

Autorest.az has been integrated into the [swagger repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs), which means it will be triggered automatically to generate the CLI code and extension for you without any extra effort as long as the readme files are ready in the swagger repo or PR. Prepare the initial readme file as documented here in [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md). 

The following is code generation step by step:

1. Create the PR in Swagger repo.

2. Try az cli extension. 

![try change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-try.JPG)

3. Review auto generated Az cli extension code. 

![preview change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-review-link.JPG)

![review change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-review-code.JPG)

4. Modify and Merge

    a. If nothing needs to be changed after review, merge the swagger PR. After the swagger PR is merged, another PR target to [Az cli extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions) will be created but marked as closed. Following the link in pipeline, find the PR for Az cli extension, reopen it and ask for code review.

    ![preview change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-release-link.JPG)

    b. If you want to change Az cli auto generated code, please pull the Az cli extension PR to local, which you reviewed in step 2.

    ![review change](images/codegen-in-swagger-pr-review-code.JPG)

    You can change the cli code and test locally with [developing guideline](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/configuring_your_machine.md). After completed, please create the Az cli extension PR target to [Az cli extension](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions) directly.

More detail can also be found in this [video](https://msit.microsoftstream.com/video/71cea3ff-0400-a9f4-01b4-f1ea9e9b130e)

## Through Docker

We have pre-prepared docker image for you to use autorest.az easily. (Please make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products) has been installed. :))

1. Start docker:
    * sync 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions.git' to {azure_cli_ext_folder} and 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs.git' to {swagger_folder}
    * login to Azure Container Registry and start the docker
    ``` bash
    > az acr login --name amecodegen
    > docker run -v {swagger_folder}:/home/swg -v {azure_cli_ext_folder}:/home/azext -it amecodegen.azurecr.io/az:2020.05.24 /bin/bash
    ```

2. Generate the code:
    * Make sure the readme files are ready in the swagger repo. We can help to prepare the init readme files for you as mentioned in [onboarding-guide](onboarding-guide.md), or you can also find example [here](../src/test/scenarios/attestation/configuration).
    * Generate the code:
    ``` bash
    > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder=/home/azext /home/swg/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
    ```

3. Run the generated command
    * Generated commands are ready to use after adding the extension:
    ``` bash
    > azdev extension add {service_name}
    # your command is ready to use now
    ```

4. Run generated test cases and style check
    * run azdev test
    ``` bash
    > azdev test {service_name}
    ```

    * run azdev linter
    ``` bash
    > azdev linter {service_name}
    ```

    * run azdev style
    ``` bash
    > azdev style {service_name}
    ```

## Through autorest command directly in local
1. Make sure your environment is good to run autorest and autorest.python by following [this](https://github.com/Azure/autorest.python/wiki/Generating-with-autorest-for-python-v5.0.0).
2. sync 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions.git' to {azure_cli_ext_folder} and 'https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs.git' to {swagger_folder}
3. Generate the code:
    * Make sure the readme files are ready in the swagger repo. To prepare the initial readme file, please following [Preparing Readme](how-to-author-readme-file.md).
    * Generate the code:
    ``` bash
    > autorest --az --azure-cli-extension-folder={azure_cli_ext_folder}   {swagger_folder}/specification/{service_name}/resource-manager/readme.md
    ```

3. Run the generated command
    * Build az extension from the generated code and load it in az
    ``` bash
    # run this in the folder with generated code: {azure_cli_ext_folder}/src/{service_name}
    > python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    > az extension add --source={azure_cli_ext_folder}/src/{service_name}/dist/{generated .whl file}
    # your az command is ready to use :)
    ```
4. Run the generated test
    * Follow the [guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/authoring_tests.md) from azure-cli for running test.

5. Run linter and style check
    * Follow the [guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/blob/dev/doc/configuring_your_machine.md#running-tests-and-checking-code-style) to run linter and style check.
